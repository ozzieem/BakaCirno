- Add fire to bulletstart position
- Add powerups? Killing enough enemies give powerups. 
  Change power of playerbullets depending on how much power player has
- Change Icon Image?
- Rework TextOverlay class so text can be changed and placed individually (?)
- Add a real highscore which saves scores and names to a file
- Add Lifepoints text next to enemies?
- (Change position of score, Time and Enemies killed text?)

DONE:
D: Highscore	(Temporary highscore for now)
D: Music & Soundeffects
D: Menu
D: New sprites
D: Gamestate implementation
D: Fired bullets still keeping in range of player.x coordinates
D: Maybe add enemyBullet list to game1 to prevent removing bullets upon death
D: Maybe bullet following player x-position type of shot?
